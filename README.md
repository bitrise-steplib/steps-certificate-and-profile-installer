# Certificate and profile installer

[![Step changelog](https://shields.io/github/v/release/bitrise-steplib/steps-certificate-and-profile-installer?include_prereleases&label=changelog&color=blueviolet)](https://github.com/bitrise-steplib/steps-certificate-and-profile-installer/releases)

Downloads and installs the Apple code signing certificates and provisioning profiles.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

The Step installs those .p12 certificate files and provisioning profiles that you uploaded to your app's **Code Signing** tab. You can upload multiple versions of any code signing file.

### Configuring the Step

By default, the Step requires no configuration. To be able to use it, you only need to upload a .p12 certificate and a matching provisioning profile to the **Code signing** tab.

However, if your certificates have passphrases, you need to make sure that passphrase is available for the Step.

1. Create a [Secret Env Var](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/builds/env-vars-secret-env-vars/) that contains the passphrase.
1. Insert that Secret to the **Certificate passphrase** input.

Similarly, you can set the path to the Keychain that should be used in the **Keychain path** input, and set a password for the Keychain in the **Keychain's password** input.

### Troubleshooting

In the case of most code signing issues, it's the **Xcode Archive & Export for iOS** Step that fails, not this one. If this Step fails, there's a couple of things you can do first.

- Check the certificate passphrase, the Keychain path and the Keychain password.
- Make sure you uploaded the required code signing files.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

<details>
<summary>Inputs</summary>

| Key | Description | Flags | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `certificate_url` | URL of the certificate to download. Multiple URLs can be specified, separated by a pipe (`\|`) character.  You can specify a local path as well, using the `file://` scheme. For example `file://./Cert.p12`  | sensitive | `$BITRISE_CERTIFICATE_URL` |
| `certificate_passphrase` | Certificate passphrase. Multiple passphrases can be specified, separated by a pipe (`\|`) character.  Specified Certificate passphrase count should match the count of the certificate urls.  Format example:  - 1 certificate provided with passphrase: `PASS` - 1 certificate provided without passphrase: `` - 3 certificates provided, none of them has passphrase: `\|\|` - 3 certificates provided, only the 2. one has passphrase: `\|PASS\|`  | sensitive | `$BITRISE_CERTIFICATE_PASSPHRASE` |
| `provisioning_profile_url` | URL of the provisioning profile to download. Multiple URLs can be specified, separated by a pipe (`\|`) character.  You can specify a local path as well, using the `file://` scheme. For example `file://./BuildAnything.mobileprovision`  | sensitive | `$BITRISE_PROVISION_URL` |
| `keychain_path` |  | required | `$HOME/Library/Keychains/login.keychain` |
| `keychain_password` |  | required, sensitive | `$BITRISE_KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD` |
| `install_defaults` | Installs default (Bitrise) Wildcard Provisioning Profile and Codesign Certificate for testing. |  | `yes` |
| `default_certificate_url` | URL of the default certificate.  You can specify a local path as well, using the `file://` scheme. For example `file://./Cert.p12`  | sensitive | `$BITRISE_DEFAULT_CERTIFICATE_URL` |
| `default_certificate_passphrase` | Certificate passphrase of the default certificate.  | sensitive | `$BITRISE_DEFAULT_CERTIFICATE_PASSPHRASE` |
| `default_provisioning_profile_url` | URL of the default provisioning profile to download.  You can specify a local path as well, using the `file://` scheme. For example `file://./BuildAnything.mobileprovision`  | sensitive | `$BITRISE_DEFAULT_PROVISION_URL` |
